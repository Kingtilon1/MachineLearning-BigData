# Data Loading and Initial Exploration

```{r data-loading}
sp500_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kingtilon1/MachineLearning-BigData/refs/heads/main/StockMarket/sp500_companies.csv")
head(sp500_data)
```
The initial data examination reveals the top 6 companies in the S&P 500. We can see that tech giants dominate the top positions, with Apple, NVIDIA, and Microsoft leading. Notably, Alphabet (Google) appears twice due to its dual-class stock structure. The data shows NVIDIA with an impressive revenue growth of 122.4%, significantly higher than its peers.

## Data Overview and Initial Insights

### Dataset Structure

```{r data-structure}
str(sp500_data)
```
The dataset contains 503 observations with 16 variables. We have a mix of character and numeric data types:
- Character variables include Exchange, Symbol, Sector, and Industry
- Numeric variables include Currentprice (ranging widely), Marketcap (in high denominations), and Revenuegrowth
- The dataset shows clean formatting with appropriate data types for each variable

### Summary Statistics

```{r summary-statistics}
summary(sp500_data)
```
The summary statistics reveal interesting insights:
- Current stock prices range from $10.13 to $8,857.62, showing extreme variation
- Market capitalization ranges from $5.84B to $3.75T, indicating the diverse size of companies
- Revenue growth averages 7.05%, but ranges from -60.2% to 163.2%
- Missing values exist in EBITDA (29), Revenue growth (3), and Full-time employees (9)
- The mean number of full-time employees is 57,745, but ranges from 28 to 2,100,000

### Missing Value Analysis

```{r missing-values}
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(sp500_data))
missing_values[missing_values > 0]
```
The missing value analysis shows three variables requiring attention:
- EBITDA: 29 missing values
- Revenue growth: 3 missing values
- Full-time employees: 9 missing values
This represents a relatively small proportion of our 503 observations but will need to be addressed in our modeling approach.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Numerical Variables Distribution

```{r numerical-distribution}
numerical_cols <- sp500_data %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  names()

sp500_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = all_of(numerical_cols), 
               names_to = "Variable", 
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Variable, y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Numerical Variables")
```
The boxplot visualization reveals:
- Extreme right-skewed distributions in Marketcap and EBITDA
- Numerous outliers in most variables, particularly in Currentprice
- Weight shows a more compressed distribution
- Revenue growth has several extreme outliers in both directions

## Correlation Analysis

```{r correlation-analysis}
cor_matrix <- sp500_data %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs")

corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", 
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)
```
The correlation matrix reveals several strong relationships:
- Market cap and EBITDA show strong positive correlation
- Weight appears highly correlated with market cap, suggesting index weighting
- Current price shows moderate correlation with market cap
- Revenue growth shows weak correlation with other variables, indicating its potential independence as a predictor

## Categorical Variable Analysis

```{r categorical-analysis}
categorical_cols <- sp500_data %>% 
  select(where(is.character)) %>% 
  names()

categorical_summary <- sp500_data %>%
  select(all_of(categorical_cols)) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), ~n_distinct(.)))

print(categorical_summary)
```
The categorical variable analysis shows:
- 4 different exchanges represented
- 503 unique symbols (as expected)
- 11 distinct sectors
- 114 different industries
- 236 cities and 42 states represented
- Nearly all companies have unique business summaries (500 distinct values)

# Feature Engineering

```{r feature-engineering}
sp500_data <- sp500_data %>%
  mutate(
    MarketCapCategory = case_when(
      Marketcap < 2e9 ~ "Small",
      Marketcap >= 2e9 & Marketcap < 10e9 ~ "Medium",
      Marketcap >= 10e9 ~ "Large"
    ),
    RevenueGrowthCategory = case_when(
      Revenuegrowth < 0 ~ "Negative",
      Revenuegrowth >= 0 & Revenuegrowth < 10 ~ "Low",
      Revenuegrowth >= 10 & Revenuegrowth < 30 ~ "Moderate",
      Revenuegrowth >= 30 ~ "High"
    )
  )
```
Created two new categorical features:
- MarketCapCategory: Classifies companies into Small, Medium, and Large based on market capitalization
- RevenueGrowthCategory: Categorizes growth rates into Negative, Low, Moderate, and High

# Predictive Modeling

## Data Preparation

```{r data-preparation}
sp500_data$HighPriceStock <- ifelse(sp500_data$Currentprice > median(sp500_data$Currentprice), 1, 0)
train_index <- createDataPartition(sp500_data$Currentprice, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- sp500_data[train_index, ]
test_data <- sp500_data[-train_index, ]
```
Data preparation steps completed:
- Created binary target variable (HighPriceStock) based on median price
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets
- Maintained proportional representation of high/low price stocks

## Logistic Regression Model

```{r logistic-regression}
logistic_model <- glm(HighPriceStock ~ Marketcap + Revenuegrowth + Ebitda, 
                      data = train_data, 
                      family = binomial())
summary(logistic_model)
```
The logistic regression results show:
- Market cap is highly significant (p < 0.001) with positive coefficient
- EBITDA is significant (p < 0.001) but with negative coefficient
- Revenue growth is not significant (p = 0.956)
- AIC of 480.2 suggests reasonable model fit
- 24 observations were excluded due to missing values

## Resampling Techniques (Bootstrap)

```{r bootstrap-analysis}
train_data_clean <- train_data %>%
  drop_na(HighPriceStock, Marketcap, Revenuegrowth, Ebitda)

sapply(train_data_clean[c("HighPriceStock", "Marketcap", "Revenuegrowth", "Ebitda")], 
       function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

control <- trainControl(method = "boot", number = 100)
bootstrap_model <- train(HighPriceStock ~ Marketcap + Revenuegrowth + Ebitda, 
                         data = train_data_clean, 
                         method = "glm", 
                         family = "binomial",
                         trControl = control)

print(bootstrap_model)
```
Bootstrap analysis results:
- Successfully removed all NA values from training data
- 100 bootstrap replicates performed
- RMSE of 0.47 indicates moderate prediction error
- R-squared of 0.13 suggests limited explanatory power
- MAE of 0.44 provides additional error metric

# Model Evaluation

```{r model-evaluation}
predictions <- predict(logistic_model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")
predicted_class <- ifelse(predictions > 0.5, 1, 0)

conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(factor(predicted_class), 
                                factor(test_data$HighPriceStock))
print(conf_matrix)
```
Model evaluation metrics:
- Overall accuracy: 70.65% (95% CI: 60.24% - 79.69%)
- High sensitivity (0.9091) but lower specificity (0.5208)
- Kappa of 0.4223 indicates moderate agreement beyond chance
- Balanced accuracy of 0.715 suggests reasonable overall performance
- McNemar's test p-value of 0.00053 indicates significant differences in error rates
